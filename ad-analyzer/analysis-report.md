---

### What's Working

- **Brand visibility:** The "ALVES estofados" logo is prominent at the top and uses a serif font that communicates some elegance.
- **Price anchor:** The strikethrough original price (R$5.340,00) next to the discounted price (R$4.270,00) creates a clear perceived value — this is a proven conversion technique.
- **"PRONTA ENTREGA" badge:** Communicating ready delivery directly addresses the #1 objection in furniture e-commerce (long wait times). This is a strong differentiator.
- **Product specs included:** Dimensions and material details (Linho Deva) target high-intent buyers who are comparison shopping.

---

### What's Missing

- **No lifestyle context:** The sofa is photographed against a plain beige wall on a tile floor — there is zero aspiration or emotional connection. Best-converting furniture ads show the product in a styled, lived-in environment.
- **No clear CTA button:** "FALE CONOSCO E GARANTA O SEU" is italic text at the very bottom — it does not stand out as an actionable element. There is no visual affordance to click.
- **No social proof:** No star rating, testimonials, or "X customers" indicator. Furniture is a high-consideration purchase and trust signals dramatically increase CTR.
- **No urgency or scarcity:** "PRONTA ENTREGA" is good, but there's no "limited stock" or time-bound offer to push action now.
- **No emotional hook in the headline:** "Sofá Veneza Cama" is a product name, not a benefit statement.
- **Brand personality is undefined:** The ad could belong to any furniture store — nothing makes Alves distinctive.

### What Needs Improvement

**Visual hierarchy:**
The eye doesn't know where to go. The dark panel covers nearly 45% of the image and competes with the sofa itself. The most important elements (price, CTA) are buried at the bottom. Hierarchy should be: Hero image → Headline → Price/offer → CTA.

**Copywriting:**
The copy is purely functional (specs, price). No emotional benefit. Should lead with a feeling: "Transforme sua sala em refúgio" (Turn your living room into a sanctuary). Bullet-point specs belong in a catalog, not an Instagram ad.

**CTA clarity:**
"FALE CONOSCO E GARANTA O SEU" is weak and vague. Replace with a clearly designed button: **"Garantir Meu Sofá →"** or **"Quero Este Sofá"** in a high-contrast pill button.

**Color/contrast:**
The dark navy (#1a2a3a) panel against the grey sofa creates a cold, industrial feel — the opposite of comfort. Warm tones (deep chocolate, warm cream, amber gold) would trigger the subconscious associations of coziness and home that drive furniture purchases.

**Image quality:**
The product photo shows a tile floor and bare wall — it signals a low-budget operation. The hero image should show the sofa in a styled living room: wooden floors, warm lighting, cushions, a coffee table. This is non-negotiable for premium positioning.

**Brand consistency:**
The serif logo suggests refinement, but the rest of the ad (cold colors, tile floor, italic CTA text) contradicts that positioning. Every element should reinforce "quality, comfort, modern design."

### Redesign Strategy

- **Target emotion/feeling:** Comfort, aspiration, confidence — "This is the sofa my home deserves"
- **Color direction:**
  - Variant A: Dark luxury (near-black + gold + cream)
  - Variant B: Warm editorial (cream + burnt orange + dark brown)
  - Variant C: Fresh lifestyle (warm white + deep teal + warm amber)
- **Typography direction:** Cormorant Garamond (headlines — serif elegance) + Proza Libre (body — readable, humanist). Max 2 fonts.
- **Layout approach:** Full-bleed AI lifestyle image of sofa in styled room → overlay with bottom-anchored card → headline + price → CTA button. No bullet-point specs.
- **CTA recommendation:** Rounded button pill with the text **"Quero Este Sofá"** or **"Garantir Meu Sofá"** — high contrast, bottom center, minimum 48px height.

### Ad Variant Plan

- **Variant A — Dark Luxury:** Near-black background, gold accent (#C9A84C), serif headline "Conforto que você merece." Price badge in gold. CTA in gold. Targets premium buyers, positions Alves as a sophisticated brand. *Best for: awareness, brand building.*

- **Variant B — Warm Editorial:** Cream background (#FFF8F0), burnt orange headline (#C2590A), lifestyle photo with natural warm light. Feels approachable and homey. More copy-forward with the discount highlighted. *Best for: direct conversion, price-sensitive audience.*

- **Variant C — Bold Full-Bleed:** AI lifestyle image fills 100% of the frame, dark gradient overlay, white bold headline dominates the top third, CTA button floats in the bottom third. Most impactful at scroll-stop. *Best for: cold traffic, awareness, stopping the scroll.*

### Benchmark Context

- Instagram furniture ads: average CTR 0.8–1.2% (industry average). High-performing lifestyle ads with clear CTAs reach 2–3%.
- Key conversion factor: Lifestyle photography outperforms product-only shots by 40–60% in furniture categories.
- Price anchoring (strikethrough) improves conversion by ~15% on average.
- Adding a CTA button (vs. text-only) improves click rate by 20–30%.
