    layout_patterns:
      cover:
        - full_bleed_image: "Large image covering 50-70% of page, text overlaid or below"
        - split_diagonal: "Diagonal divide between image and solid color areas"
        - centered_minimal: "Large centered title with generous whitespace, subtle background"
        - bold_typography: "Typography-driven cover, minimal imagery, strong font hierarchy"
      inner_page:
        - two_column: "Content split into 2 columns for readability"
        - sidebar_layout: "70/30 split - main content left, highlights/stats right sidebar"
        - cards_grid: "2x2 or 3x1 card grid for features/benefits"
        - full_width_sections: "Alternating full-width bands of content with different backgrounds"
        - hero_stat: "One massive number/stat as focal point, supporting text around it"

    design_principles:
      - "CONTRAST between pages — alternate dark/light backgrounds across spreads"
      - "Every page should have ONE clear focal point"
      - "Use whitespace generously — 30-40% of page should be empty"
      - "Consistent header system across all inner pages"
      - "Footer with page number, brand name, contact on every page"
      - "Image placeholders should show intended aspect ratio and position"
